                    Consider:
                    1. The the screenshots
                    2. If the sequence of actions taken make sense and there are no unimportant extra steps
                    3. Whether the task requirements were met
                    
                    You MUST respond with a valid JSON object containing exactly these fields:
                    - status: integer (1-4) where:
                      1 = Perfect execution: output is correct and steps are efficient
                      2 = Correct but inefficient: output is correct but has extra/unnecessary steps
                      3 = Wrong output, good steps: final result is wrong but the approach/steps were good
                      4 = Complete failure: both output and steps are wrong
                    - analysis: string explaining the status (required for status 2,3,4)

                    Example responses (you must return EXACTLY one of these formats):
                    {"status": 1}
                    {"status": 2, "analysis": "Task completed correctly but had unnecessary steps 2-3 before finding the right approach in step 4"}
                    {"status": 3, "analysis": "The meeting was created at the wrong time (2:00 PM instead of 3:00 PM) but the steps to create it were correct"}
                    {"status": 4, "analysis": "Failed to create the meeting - wrong approach and wrong time"}

                    IMPORTANT: 
                    - Your entire response must be a single valid JSON object. Do not include any other text or explanation outside the JSON.
                    - Do not be too strict with the success judgment, be flexible for details that are not explicitly stated in the task.
                    - Ex: If the task doesn't specify the specific hours, only that the event was for the full day tomorrow, it's ok if the task was assigned to a particular time as long as the date is right.
                    - Be flexible about the type of action (task/reminder/event) as long as the core task is completed correctly.
                    - NEVER assume or verify details that are not explicitly mentioned in the task:
                      * If day of week is not specified, don't check or mention it - the day of week doesn't matter as long as the date is correct
                      * If year is not specified, don't check or mention it
                      * If time is not specified, don't check or mention it
                      * If location is not specified, don't check or mention it
                      * If attendees are not specified, don't check or mention them
                    - For dates: ONLY verify the month and day if specified. The day of week and year should be ignored unless explicitly required."""
